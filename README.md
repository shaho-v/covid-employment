# Women's Employment Over the COVID-19 Pandemic

## Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic represented a shock not only in terms of public health but also  on the worldwide economy. Given the varying roles of women in the workforce across countries, sectors, and skill, we seek to assess the pandemicâ€™s differential effect on the female-to-male employment ratio. We observed positive impacts on women with higher skill levels, but a negative effect in general due to the pandemic. We may attribute some of this due to the existence of remote work in some sectors and the increase in unpaid domestic care work removing some women from the labour force.
